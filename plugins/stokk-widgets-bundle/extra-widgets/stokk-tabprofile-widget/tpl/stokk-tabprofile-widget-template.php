                                <strong>Our story began in March 2010</strong> at LaGuardia Airport in New York. We were both going
                                back to school in Atlanta. After a mutual friend introduced us we realized our seats were
                                very close to each other. Dan could tell that Ariel, a classic nervous flyer, could use some
                                support. A
                                <strong>pretty turbulent flight </strong>allowed us to get to know each other. Throughout the rest
                                of the semester we became good friends. As summer approached, we learned that we would be
                                interning across the street from each other. After having lunch together every day that summer
                                we both knew it was only a matter of time.
                                <strong> we got back to school for fall semester the rest was history!</strong>
